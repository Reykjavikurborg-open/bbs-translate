"","What type of data the field will store",""
"","Each field can store one type of data (text, number, file, etc.). When you define a field, you choose a particular <em>field type</em>, which corresponds to the type of data you want to store. The field type cannot be changed after you have created the field.",""

"","You can store one value, a specific maximum number of values, or an unlimited number of values in each field.

This setting can be changed after you have created the field, but if you reduce the maximum number of values, you may lose information.",""
"","Reusing fields",""
"","Once you have defined a field, you can reuse it. For example, if you define a custom image field for one content type, and you need to have an image field with the same parameters on another content type, you can add the same field to the second content type, in the <em>Add existing field</em> area of the user interface. You could also add this field to a taxonomy vocabulary, comments, user accounts, etc.",""
"","Some settings of a reused field are unique to each use of the field; others are shared across all places you use the field. For example, the label of a text field is unique to each use, while the setting for the number of values is shared.",""
"","There are two main reasons for reusing fields. First, reusing fields can save you time over defining new fields. Second, reusing fields also allows you to display, filter, group, and sort content together by field across content types. For example, the contributed Views module allows you to create lists and tables of content. So if you use the same field on multiple content types, you can create a View containing all of those content types together displaying that field, sorted by that field, and/or filtered by that field.",""

"","""Once you have defined a field, you can reuse it.
